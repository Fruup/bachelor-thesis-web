First and foremost, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Elmar Sch√∂mer and Dr. Rainer Erbes for being my supervisors during the writing of this thesis. They are always able to move their students in the right direction and are ready to help where help is needed.

I also want to thank Yan Chernikov, the creator of the YouTube channel \textit{TheCherno} where he uploads excellent videos on topics related to computer graphics and programming in general.
